# How to configure the Google plugin

There is no configuration required at Plugin level.

All you need to do is click on the `Add Google components` button on the left.

This will add the **[Google Maps](https://docs.weweb.io/maps-element/) and Google reCAPTCHA elements** in the `Add` Menu of your project:

You can then drag-and-drop these elements wherever you want in your project.
